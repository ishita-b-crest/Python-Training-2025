This method is preferred when a.
single line or a range of lines from a. 
file needs to be accessed simultaneously.
It can be easily used to print lines from.
any random starting index to some ending index. 
It initially reads the entire.
content of the file.
and keep a copy of i.
in memory. The lines at the.
specified indices are then accessed.
